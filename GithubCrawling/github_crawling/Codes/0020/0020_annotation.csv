/**
 * Functions needed to handle signals for Java.
 *
 * The signal handler itself, cSunMiscSignal_countingHandler, runs on a borrowed thread stack and
 * will not have access to any VM thread-local information or the Java heap base register. Therefore
 * it is written in C code rather than in Java code.
 *
 * Any data the signal handler references must not be in the Java heap, so it is allocated here. The
 * data consists of a table indexed by signal numbers of atomic counters, and a semaphore for
 * notifying of increments to the values of the counters.
 *
 * The other public functions here are operations on the data allocated here, for the convenience of
 * the code in Target_sun_misc_Signal.
 *
 * The state for handling signals is global to a process, and has no knowledge of isolates. That
 * imposes the restriction that only one isolate at a time may register to receive signals.
 * Otherwise I would have to notify multiple isolates when a signal arrived, which violates the rule
 * against per-isolate knowledge.

*
* This is the standard DeltaBlue benchmark. A long chain of equality
* constraints is constructed with a stay constraint on one end. An edit
* constraint is then added to the opposite end and the time is measured for
* adding and removing this constraint, and extracting and executing a
* constraint satisfaction plan. There are two cases. In case 1, the added
* constraint is stronger than the stay constraint and values must propagate
* down the entire length of the chain. In case 2, the added constraint is
* weaker than the stay constraint so it cannot be accomodated. The cost in
* this case is, of course, very low. Typical situations lie somewhere between
* these two extremes.
*
****************************************************************************/

 *
 * This test constructs a two sets of variables related to each other by a
 * simple linear transformation (scale and offset). The time is measured to
 * change a variable on either side of the mapping and to change the scale or
 * offset factors. It has been tested for up to 2000 variable pairs.

   sometimes rejects '/') and removing redundant separators.  The input path is
   assumed to have been converted into the character encoding used by the local
   system.  Because this might be a double-byte encoding, care is taken to
   treat double-byte lead characters correctly.

   This procedure modifies the given path in place, as the result is never
   longer than the original.  There is no error return; this operation always
   succeeds. */
